A data science project analyzing video games Sales and trends
# ðŸŽ® Video Game Sales & Trends Analysis

Welcome to my data science project where I explore the world of video games using real-world data. This project dives into how video games perform across different regions, which genres are most loved, and how platforms have evolved over time.

Using Python and data visualization tools, I cleaned and analyzed a dataset with thousands of game records. I looked into sales trends, genre popularity.

This project helped me apply key data science skills â€” from data wrangling and feature engineering to creating insightful visualizations. It also taught me how to handle messy data and communicate findings effectively, which Iâ€™ve summarized in a short presentation.

Whether you're a fellow data science student, a gamer, or just curious, I hope you find something interesting here!
